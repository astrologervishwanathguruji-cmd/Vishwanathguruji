      'Black magic, voodoo, and dark tantric forces can disrupt every dimension of life, health, relationships, finances, and peace of mind. Pandit Sri Vishwanath Guruji has spent over three decades mastering the counter-rituals from the Atharva Veda and Tantra Shastra to neutralise these influences. Through diagnosis of your birth chart and the symptoms you describe, Guruji identifies the source and intensity of the negativity. Sacred yantras are then prepared, protective mantras are recited over multiple sittings, and personalised remedial pujas are performed at the centre. Every ritual is conducted with strict adherence to Vedic procedure, guaranteeing your safety and complete spiritual cleansing.',
